# :rocket: Challenge #4 React Native concepts
This repository its part of my web studies with Rocketseat bootcamp (GoStack).

## :pushpin: The task ##
This project its related with a previous [Node.js Challenge](https://github.com/gustavo-candido/Desafio-02-Conceitos-do-Node.js)

In this challenge, using __React Native__ and __Axios__, I have build a simple mobile App capable to consume my API services
of show and like repositories


## :mag: Implementation details ##

- By now is not possible to create the repositories using just the APP, so you need create via Insomnia how it has 
show on the API `README`

## :wrench: Instalation ##
<em>Obs: You need to follow the Instalation steps of the previus challenge.</em>

**You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) first, then in order to clone the project via HTTPS, run this command:**

```git clone https://github.com/gustavo-candido/Desafio-04-Conceitos-do-React-Native.git```


**Install dependencies:**
